## About the Project

Sometimes, the best way to understand and process our emotions is to visualize them. *Antares Murmurs* is your guide in this journeyâ€”an interactive experience that helps you explore your feelings by connecting them with the stars. Whether youâ€™re lost in thought, overwhelmed, or seeking inspiration, this project transforms emotions into celestial stories, weaving together astronomy, artificial intelligence, storytelling and music to create a deeply personal experience.

**Antares Murmurs** allows users to describe their current emotional state, and the system matches them with a star whose scientific properties, mythology, and symbolic meaning resonate with their feelings. 

## Current Features
- **Star Data Retrieval**: Fetches real-time star data from the **SIMBAD Astronomical Database**.
- **Processed Star Characteristics**: Calculated additional stellar parameters and ensured proper transmission of essential star properties.
- **AI-Generated Mythology**: GPT-4o analyzes mythology and symbolism for selected stars.
- **Caching with Redis**: Frequently accessed star data and mythology descriptions are cached for performance optimization.
- **Database Storage**: PostgreSQL stores filtered star data and emotion mappings for efficient retrieval.
- **API Endpoints**: FastAPI-based backend provides structured responses for frontend integration.

## Planned Enhancements
- **Improved Emotion Mapping**: Refining the algorithm for deeper and more nuanced emotional analysis. Implementing FAISS to store and search emotions in a high-dimensional vector space.
- **Dynamic Star Selection**: Enhancing the matching logic to consider pulsation, brightness variation, and spectral details.
- **User Interaction Features**: Enabling users to explore personal star histories and save their matched stars.
- **Frontend Development**: Building a web interface for a seamless user experience.
- **Music & Visual Effects**: Integrating Spotify API for mood-based music selection and WebGL for visualizations.
- **Deployment**: Dockerized and planned for AWS deployment.
